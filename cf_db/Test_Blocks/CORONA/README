-----------------------------------------------------

CORONA is an AXE block which can be used to scan for potential hanging software individuals.
It does this by comparing variable contents in the AXE against predefined allowed values which has been loaded with the TOBJL command.
If the memory contents are not one of the allowed values and the pointer of the found variable is not one of the excluded ones, 
it is reported as a possible hanging individual. 
By default the block can check for hangings in upto 2000 different variables (objects) and can exclude upto 1000 pointers
and can report upto 2000 hanging variables. But these can be increased by doing a size alteration of SAE 500 for number of objects,
SAE 501 for number of exclude pointers and SAE 502 for number of hangings. 
The datafile which contains TOBJL-data can be automatically updated with changed variable numbers using the checktobjl tool.
